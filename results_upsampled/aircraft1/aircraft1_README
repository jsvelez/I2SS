DATASETS: aircraft1.pcd (original)
          aircraft1_final.pcd (upsampled version)

SEGMENTATION RESULTS:
        Curiously, both RANSAC and MLESAC return the exact same results. This is probably because the points in the input clouds have strong likelihood
        (i.e. it is easy to tell which points are outliers relative to what plane), which often causes MLESAC estimation to reduce to the RANSAC case.
        Upsampling the data seems to have made no actual difference. Still, we managed to achieve an ideal segmentation and successfully recognized the
        aircraft as a separate object.
                          
MISC. OBSERVATIONS:
          When comparing the original point-clouds to the combined output in all three versions, there seems to be some noticeable banding in the
          results, even though the filtered cloud (pre-segmentation) has exactly or almost exactly the same number of points as the actual input.
