DATASETS: circular1.pcd (original)
          circular1_final.pcd (upsampled version)
          circular1_final.pcd (upsampled version w/ different parameters)

SEGMENTATION RESULTS:
        -->using RANSAC: The best RANSAC result was the one obtained from the upsampled version. The roof of the circular building, part
                         of the wall points grabbed by the aerial scan, and the ground plane were all segmented out neatly, as well as a 
                         cluster near one of the corners that looks like the roof of a shed or something. The alternate upsample segmented
                         the circular roof into two pieces, though everything else remained accurate. 

         -->using MLESAC: MLESAC was generally more sensitive to small changes in ground elevation; it detected the small 'slope' off the side
                          of the building for all three versions of this dataset. Both upsampled versions also detected a couple more short height
                          variations near the opposite side.
                          
MISC. OBSERVATIONS:
          When comparing the original point-clouds to the combined output in all three versions, there seems to be some noticeable banding in the
          results, even though the filtered cloud (pre-segmentation) has exactly or almost exactly the same number of points as the actual input.
